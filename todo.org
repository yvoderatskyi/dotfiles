* TODO Git
  I want to:
+ set my name. my email should be set per project.
+ add a few aliases
+ configure a different diff tool - [[https://github.com/dandavison/delta][Delta]].
* TODO Emacs / Spacemacs 
  The configuration is not tangled. I should fix this.
* TODO Brew - Brewfile
  I install quite a few apps to Mac and want to automate that.
